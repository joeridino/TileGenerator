# TileGenerator
TileGenerator is a browser app that creates random and non-random 2D game tiles for you.  The outputted tiles in some cases may not stitch together without seams but some do.  They are meant as a starting point and should be edited in a paint program where necessary.

## Features
* Mix and match colors with the browser's color picker.
* Adjust color weights to make colors stand out or go away.
* Choose the tile size you want (multiples of 32).
* Map preview shows a 3x3 grid to see how the tiles stitch together.
* Tiles can be saved by right-clicking and choosing "Save Image As...".
* All settings are saved in local storage -- next time you visit your colors and weights are the same (randomly generated images obviously get regenerated).
